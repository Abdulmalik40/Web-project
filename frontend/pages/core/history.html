              The Arabian Peninsula in the early 12th century AH (18th century CE) was in a state of chaos and political instability. Historians described the political and social conditions in the Arabian Peninsula during that period as fragmented, insecure, with numerous scattered and conflicting emirates.

As a result of the establishment of the Saudi State, many scholars emerged, and knowledge, scientific, and economic aspects flourished.

              Many institutions and administrative systems were established. The First Saudi State enjoyed great political status due to its strength and Islamic principles, its vast geographical expanse, and the balanced policies of its rulers based on supporting Islam and serving society and elevating its civilizational level. The First Saudi State ended in 1233 AH (1818 CE) as a result of campaigns sent by the Ottoman Empire through its governor in Egypt, Muhammad Ali, the last of which was Ibrahim Pasha's campaign that succeeded in destroying Diriyah and many towns in the regions of the First Saudi State throughout the Arabian Peninsula.

The people in both the desert and settled areas remained loyal to the House of Saud, which founded the First Saudi State, appreciating their treatment and wise leadership, and supporting the Salafi call. Not two years had passed since the end of the First Saudi State before the leaders from the House of Saud reappeared to re-establish the Saudi State.
